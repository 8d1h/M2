# this approach to fixing "abort" doesn't work because of a slight
# bug in configure/makeconf - strings here get evaluated by the
# shell a different number of times between now and
#   (1) the evaluation of the test compilations in factory/configure
#   (2) the evaluation of the compilations in factory/GNUmakefile
# and thus it is impossible to shield the parentheses from the shell.
# A fix is for all expressions in factory/configure like 
#	eval $ac_compile
# to be replaced by expressions like
#	eval `eval "echo $ac_compile"`
