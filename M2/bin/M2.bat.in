rem  Edit this file and change the paths in the lines below to reflect the
rem  path to the main Macaulay2 directory.  That directory is the one
rem  containing subdirectories "cache", "emacs", "html", "libexec", ...
rem  Its name ends with something like lib/Macaulay2-0.9.2.
rem  You have to write the same path twice!  Once with forward slashes, and
rem  once with backward slashes.
rem  The same path will have to be put into the file emacs/M2-init.el.

rem  The slashes in the next line should be /
set M2HOME=s:/cygwin/usr/local/lib/Macaulay2-@PACKAGE_VERSION@

rem  The slashes in the next line should be \
set M2WINH=s:\cygwin\usr\local\lib\Macaulay2-@PACKAGE_VERSION@

rem  Don't change this line.
%M2WINH%\bin\Macaulay2 -tty -ephase=1 %M2HOME%/m2/setup.m2 -ephase=0 '-e runStartFunctions()'
