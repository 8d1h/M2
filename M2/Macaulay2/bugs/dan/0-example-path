If you run M2 with a relative path, such as ../../BUILD/foo/M2 on the command
line, then installPackage copies that as the name of the command for running
examples, but it changes to a different directory, so the command is not found.

There are two work-arounds: add the absolute directory to the front of the PATH
environment variable and type just M2 as the command; or use an absolute path.

Fix it.
