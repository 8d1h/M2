/**
   The idea of this file is that we build platform files for the various platforms.
   We choose not to do the configure ifdef route because it produces too much code base fragmentation.
   Using configure effectively produces n^2 code bases where n is number of configure options.
   Furthermore, in most cases, deviations from say, the POSIX standard, are small.
   So we can choose to just say the system is POSIX and then special case the few exceptions.
   By comparison differences between posix and win32/64 are large and so should not even be in the same file.
   Style dictates that if there are to be ifdefs, a whole new function is created.
   No inline ifdefs are permitted.
