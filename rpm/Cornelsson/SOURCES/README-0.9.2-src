You may get an error message about ignore_this_symbol being an undefined
symbol when compiling version 0.9.2.  If so, replace the line

#include <vector.h> // just to get swap(), which is included from algobase.h by vector.h, gcc 3.0

in Macaulay2/e/style.hpp with these lines:

#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
