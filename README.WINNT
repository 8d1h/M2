Use Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 with the workspace M2.dsw and set the active
configuration to be "Macaulay2 -Win32 Release".  It will produce the
executable:

	Macaulay2/d/Release/Macaulay2.exe

Test it by running it in the directory

	Macaulay2/m2

with the command line argument

	setup.m2

I think it's a bug in Microsoft's development environment that the
information above is saved in the file M2.opt instead of in
Macaulay2/Macaulay2.dsp.
