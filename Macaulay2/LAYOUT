File System Layout

We aim for compatibility with both http://www.pathname.com/fhs/
and http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/packaging/fslayout.php

See also http://cr.yp.to/unix.html, the section on "Filesystem layout", for another way, which
we'll support eventually, too.

The following paths are relative to ".".  When the files are installed by the system administrator,
then "." is usually /usr, /usr/local, or /sw.  When the files are packaged into a tar file by the
package author, then the name of the tar file should be PACKAGE-RELEASE.tar.gz, where PACKAGE is
the package name, e.g., "Macaulay2" or "D-modules", and RELEASE is the version number, containing
no hyphens, e.g. 0.9.4 or 1.0.  Tar files contain exactly the paths below, with "." replaced by
PACKAGENAME-RELEASENUMBER, e.g, Macaulay2-0.9.4, or D-modules-1.0.  The name of the tarfile should be
PACKAGENAME-RELEASENUMBER-ARCH.tar.gz, where ARCH is a string that gives information about the
architecture for which Macaulay2 has been compiled.  The tar file may contain ordinary files in
the directory PACKAGENAME-RELEASENUMBER, and the installer should *not* copy them to /usr or to
/sw.  Examples might be README, COPYING, LICENSE, encapinfo.
