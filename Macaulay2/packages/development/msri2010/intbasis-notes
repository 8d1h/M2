Written by Mark van Hoeij and Mike Stillman:

Situation:

F(x,y) in kk[x,y], char k = p (p is probably small prime)
assume F' := dF/dy != 0 (if it is, swap x,y).
(*) assume lc(F) does not vanish at x=0 (this condition might become not needed)

Plan: compute a local integral basis at x=0 (if alpha is a root of the
discriminant, then we will change coordinates x => x+alpha, update kk =
kk(alpha))

At d-th step of the algorithm, we have computed b0, b1, ..., b(d-1) (as polynomials in y)
bi = (y^i + lower degree in y, with x's in them)/x^(d_i).

Initially, let bd := b(d-1) * y (if not (*),then use b1 instead of y, as it is
integral). (at this stage, we have already updated the table below. (**)

To attempt to update bd, consider:
  A/x = (sum(ci, bi) + bd)/x.
For which ci, if any, is this integral?
Note, from Mark's paper, if it exists, it is unique.

To determine the ci, we need linear equations.
Some necessary conditions:
A F' == 0 (mod x^1)  (and also F, of course)
A^p F' == 0 (mod x^p)
... (and so on)

We keep a table (**) of:
bi F' (mod F,x^1)  (all i)
bi^p F' (mod F, x^p)
... (and so on, EXCEPT: if we have some p^i greater than some bound B (see below),
  then we work mod F, x^B)

and a table (***)
y^(p^i) mod (F, x^(min(B,p^i))) (all i, likely a small table)

Note: if p^i > B, for some B to be determined below, then the conditions
A^(p^i) F' == 0 (mod x^B, F)
become sufficient for A/x to be integral.

Note: Fp(x) has a natural valuation taking values in the
integers (and infinity, of course).  This extends to Fp(x)[y]/F to finitely 
many valuations, one for each place above x=0.  These valuations take values
in 1/ri ZZ union infinity, where ri is the ramification index of the i-th place.

Choose j so that p^j >= Int_i * ri, for all places i.  
Then take B = -p^j/ri + Int_i + p^j. (note this implies that B <= p^j)
With this choice of B, and p^j, 
  A/x is integral iff A^(p^j) * F' == 0 mod (x^B, F).

Argument: If A/x is not integral, then it has negative valuation at at least
one place Pi above x=0.  Then the valuation at Pi of A/x is <= - 1/ri.  Let the
valuation of F' at Pi be Int_i.  Then the valuation of (A/x)^(p^j) * F' is <=
-p^j/ri + Int_i.  Then the valuation of A^(p^j) * F' <= -p^j/ri + Int_i + p^j.
If B > -p^j/ri + Int_i + p^j, then A^(p^j)*F' cannot vanish mod x^B.

Notes: For j' < j, we get necessary conditions for A/x to be integral from:
A^(p^j') F' == 0 mod (x^(p^j'),F).
Perhaps using the equations can speed up the algorithm, perhaps not.

Using a limited version of the Puiseux algorithm (i.e. once you detect wild
ramification, stop computing more terms.  This gives upper bounds for both ri
and Int_i.

Hopefully, this is fast for small p.
