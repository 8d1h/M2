  Key
    PowerSeries
  Headline
    A package allowing construction andmanipulatioon of power series in one variable.
  Description
    Text     
      A power series is normally described on paper in the form "a_0 + a_1x + a_2 x^2 + ...", and
      the ellipsis in the above description is implemented to maximize efficiency. By analogy
      with floating point numbers, a power series is only ever calculated to finite precision,
      but power series in this package also contain enough information to generate arbitrarily
      more precision when needed. Combined with some caching abilities, this means that
      power series whose coefficients are very difficult to compute can be manipulated
      without sacrificing the ability to calculate more terms at a later time.
      
      There are large documentation nodes included for @TO "Creating Series"@ and
      @TO"Operations on Series"@.
///

doc ///
  Key
    "Creating Series"
  Headline
    An overview of the various ways to create power series.
  Description
   Text
     Most series have enough information to extend their polynomial approximation to 
     arbitrary degree when needed. This means that even though sums and products of
     series will return finite-precision results, the precision can be increased at
     any time. The easiest examples of such series are:
     
     1. Creating series by the @TO2 (series,RingElement),"input of a rational function"@.
     
     2. Creating series @TO2 (series,Divide),"from a Divide"@, for instance to process the result of a @TO hilbertSeries@ computation.

     3. Creating series @TO2 (series,RingElement,Function)@ "given the coefficients"@, by giving a function that computes the i^{th} coefficient of the power series.

     4. Creating series by @TO2( (seriesPartialSums,Function) "giving a function") that given i, computes the i^{th} polynomial approximation to the series.

     Series can also be created that have finite precision. If the user only knows the series
     up to a certain degree, series computations can still be used on it. If the precision 
     of such a series is ever increased too far, an error will result.
     
     5. Creating @TO2 (series,ZZ,RingElement),"series with finite precision"@.
     
     The best way to implement a power series whose coefficients are difficult to compute is
     using one of the following two constructions: 
     
     6. Creating @TO2 (series,Ring,Function),"series given the ability to calculate individual terms"@, and
     
     7. Creating @TO2 (series,RingElement,ZZ,Function),"series given the ability to calculate individual terms"@ where some computation is already done.
     
     Methods 4, 6, and 7 provide great flexibility and allow almost any power series to be entered, but the last two provide a
     significant computational advantages if the coefficients of the power series are difficult to compute. In the last two cases,
     previously computed coefficients will never be computed again.
    
     As an example, we will enter a power series whose coefficients involve (needless) heavy computation:
   Example
     f = i -> value factor(10^i + 1);
   Text
     If a function for the i^{th} coefficient is used to construct the series, then successive increases in precision do not redo computations:
   Example
     R = ZZ[x];
     A = series(x,f);
     time A = setDegree(39,A);
     time A = setDegree(40,A);
   Text
     If a function for the i^{th} polynomial approximation is ussed instead, then successive precision increases repeat old computations:
   Example
     B = seriesPartialSums(i -> sum(i,(j -> f(j)*x^j)));
     time B = setDegree(39,B);
     time B = setDegree(40,B);
   Text
     Even if a closed form for the i^{th} coefficient is not known, and instead the user only knows how to recursively increase the precision, one of methods 6 or 7 successfully uses the cache:
   Example
     C = series(R,(oldPolynomial,oldDegree,newDegree) -> oldPolynomial + sum(oldDegree+1:newDegree,j -> f(j)*x^j));
     time C = setDegree(40,C);
     time C = setDegree(41,C);
