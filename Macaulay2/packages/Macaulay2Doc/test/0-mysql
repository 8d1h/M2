We should move the engine routines for mysql into an experimental package.  Perhaps we should allow exporting
symbols from elsewhere, even though it can be dangerous for the user.

    i1 : newPackage "foo"

    o1 = foo

    o1 : Package

    i2 : debug Core

    i3 : errorDepth = 0

    o3 = 0

    i6 : export { symbol findHeft }
    ../../../m2/debugging.m2:4:17:(0):[4]: symbol 'findHeft' defined elsewhere, not in current package: foo
