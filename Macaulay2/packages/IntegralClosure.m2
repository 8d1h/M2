-- PURPOSE : Compute the integral closure of a ring via the algorithm 
--           in Theo De Jong's paper, An Algorithm for 
--           Computing the Integral Closure, J. Symbolic Computation, 
--           (1998) 26, 273-277. 
-- PROGRAMS : integralClosure
--            isNormal
--            ICFractions
--            ICMap
-- The fractions that generate the integral closure over R/I are obtained 
-- by the command ICfractions(R/I).  
-- Included is a command conductor that computes the conductor of S into R
-- where S is the image of a ring map from R to S where S is finite over
-- R.  ICmap constructs this map (the natural map R/I->R_j/I_j) for R 
-- into its integral closure and applying conductor to this map 
-- yeilds the conductor of the integral closure into R.

-- PROGRAMMERs : This implementation was written by and is maintained by
--               Amelia Taylor.

-- First we have several helper functions for the integralClosure 
-- function.  These functions are described below with the actual 
-- front end function for integralClosure much further down.

-- As the engine code changes, comparisons of the time for 
-- radical and radical0 must be checked.  16.5.01 radical0 
-- in the code is universally faster.  However, for the 
-- example in Wolmer's book where one takes the radical of 3
-- generators, radical computes it in about 4 or 5 sec and 
-- radical0 does not finish.
radical0 = (I) -> (
     I = ideal mingens ideal generators gb I;

     result)


-- The idea of ICnode is to keep track of where we are in the process
-- and the various maps and fractions we generate.  It is particularly 
-- important in the reduced-not-domain case since we have to divide the 
-- the ring into pieces and keep track of those we have normalized.

-- The idea in general is to use normal0 to find the 
-- Non-normal locus.  First looking at the singular locus.  If it 
-- is just variables (max'l ideal) then it matches the NNL and we 
-- use it.  If not then we use the Jacobian to compute the NNL.

-- Once we have the defining ideal for the NNL we use idealizer0
-- to start looking at Hom(J,J).  (Recall (1/f)(fJ:J)=Hom(J,J) where f 
-- is a NZD in J mod I.)  For the reduced not domain case we must check 
-- for a NZD and if I:f strictly contains I and f is in J but not I then 
-- we consider the two new rings R/I:f and R/I:(I:f), continuing the 
-- process with these.  In the domain case we could just pick the first 
-- generator of J that is not in I works.

-- ICnode is a mutable hash table that allows us to collect all of the 
-- necessary information throughout this process.  Most of the elements 
-- in the hash table are clear, however, C#"todo", C#"pending", C#"storing" and 
-- C#"answer" are the key pieces to working through the algorithm.  C#"todo" is
-- the ideal that we need to work on next before starting the algorithm.  Once
-- the algorithm is started this ideal, along with its NNL (once computed) are
-- stored in C#"pending" and C#"todo" = {}.  After we have passed through the 
-- algorithm once newI and newJ are put into C#"todo" and we begin again.  If 
-- a zero divisor is detected (in idealizer0) then the first ideal, I, in 
-- C#"pending" is split into I:f and I:I:f.  I:f is placed in C#"todo" so that 
-- the algorithm can begin again with that ideal and I:I:f is placed in 
-- C#"storing".  Once the integral closure of R_i/I_i for some I_i is obtained, 
-- then the defining ideal of theis integral closure is placed in C#"answer".

-- OUTPUT : a sequence of quotient rings R_1/I_1,..., R_n/I_n such that the integral closure 
--          of R/I is the direct sum of those rings
-- HELPER FUNCTIONS: next       - facilitiates the iteration.
--                   newICnode  - builds a mutable hash table used to track the pieces during the iteration.
--                   normal0  - computes the non-normal locus
--                   idealizer0 - DeJong's algorthim to compute the integral closure using the non-normal locus.
--                   indirectly, radical0
-- COMMENT: The quotient rings are not necessarily domains.  The algorithm can correctly 
--          proceed without decomposing a reduced ring if it finds a non-zero divisor with 
--          which to compute 1/f(fJ:J).
