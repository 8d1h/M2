-- PURPOSE : Front end for the integralClosure function.  It governs the 
--           iterative process using the helper function next.
-- INPUT : any Ring that is a polynomial ring or a quotient of a polynomial
--         ring that is reduced. 
-- OUTPUT : a sequence of quotient rings R_1/I_1,..., R_n/I_n such that the integral closure 
--          of R/I is the direct sum of those rings
-- HELPER FUNCTIONS: next       - facilitiates the iteration.
--                   newICnode  - builds a mutable hash table used to track the pieces during the iteration.
--                   normal0  - computes the non-normal locus
--                   idealizer0 - DeJong's algorthim to compute the integral closure using the non-normal locus.
--                   indirectly, radical
-- COMMENT: The quotient rings are not necessarily domains.  The algorithm can correctly 
--          proceed without decomposing a reduced ring if it finds a non-zero divisor with 
--          which to compute 1/f(fJ:J).
