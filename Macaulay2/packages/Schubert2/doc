    computation in intersection theory
  Description
    Text
      The primary purpose of this package is to help compute with intersection theory
      on smooth varieties.  An @TO2{AbstractVariety,"abstract variety"}@ is not given by equations.
      Instead, one gives its intersection ring (usually modulo numerical equivalence),
      its dimension, the Chern class of its tangent bundle, and a method for
      computing integrals.  An @TO2{AbstractSheaf,"abstract sheaf"}@ is represented by its total Chern class (or by its Chern
      character).  An @TO2{AbstractVarietyMap,"abstract variety map"}@ is a map between abstract
      varieties: the information encoded is the pull-back and push-forward
      maps between the corresponding intersection rings.

      This package and its documentation are still rather incomplete, but see the examples in
      @TO "Lines on hypersurfaces"@ and @TO "Conics on a quintic threefold"@, which should
      be enough to figure out some of what's possible.

    The Schubert2 data type of an abstract variety
  Description
   Text
     An abstract variety in {\em Schubert2} 
     is defined by its dimension and a $\QQ$-algebra, interpreted as the rational Chow ring.
     For example, the following code defines the abstract variety corresponding to $\PP^2$,
     with its Chow ring A. Once the variety X is created, we can access its structure
     sheaf OO_X, represented by its Chern class.

   Example
     A=QQ[t]/ideal(t^3)
     X=abstractVariety(2,A)
     OO_X
     chern OO_X
   Text
     A variable of type AbstractVariety is actually of type MutableHashTable, and can
     contain other information, such as its @TO TangentBundle@. Once this is defined,
     we can compute the Todd class.
   Example
	X.TangentBundle  = abstractSheaf(X,Rank=>2, ChernClass=>(1+t)^3)
	todd X
   Text
     If we want things like the Euler characteristic of a sheaf, we must also
     specify a method to take the @TO integral@ for the Chow ring A; in the case
     where A is Gorenstein, as is the Chow ring of a complete nonsingular variety,
     this is a functional that takes the highest degree component. 
     In the following example, The sheaf OO_X is
     the structure sheaf of X, and OO_X(2t) is the line bundle with first Chern class 2t.
     The computation of the Euler Characteristic is made using the Todd class and the 
     Riemann-Roch formula.
   Example
     integral A := f -> coefficient(t^2,f)    
     chi(OO_X(2*t))
   Text
      There are several other methods for constructing abstract varieties: the following functions
      construct basic useful varieties (often returning the corresponding structure map).
      @TO projectiveSpace@,
      @TO projectiveBundle@,
      @TO flagBundle@,
      @TO base@.

      This package and its documentation are still rather incomplete, but see the examples
      @TO "Lines on hypersurfaces"@ and @TO "Conics on a quintic threefold"@, which should
      be enough to figure out some of what's possible.

    the class of all abstract sheaves
  Description
   Text
     A virtual {\em abstract sheaf} over @ofClass AbstractVariety@ $X$ is specified by giving its rank and its total Chern class,
     as an element of the intersection ring of $X$.

     For example, the Horrocks-Mumford bundle on projective 4-space
     can be constructed with the following code.  We first produce a base point
     whose intersection ring contains a variable named {\tt n}, in 
     terms of which we can compute the Hilbert polynomial.
   Example
     pt = base(n)
   Text
     Then we create the projective space of dimension 4 over the base point, 
     using the {\tt VariableName} option to specify that $h$ is the variable to use to represent the first
     Chern class of the tautological quotient line bundle on the projective space.
   Example
    X = projectiveSpace(4,pt,VariableName => h)
   Text
     Now we create an abstract sheaf of rank 2 with $1 + 5 h + 10 h^2$ as its total Chern class.
   Example
     F = abstractSheaf(X, Rank => 2, ChernClass => 1 + 5*h + 10*h^2)
   Text
     Its class is @ TO AbstractSheaf @:
   Example
     class F
   Text
     Now we compute the Hilbert polynomial of $F$.

    chi F(n*h)

     If we want a projective space where we can compute the Hilbert Polynomial of a sheaf,
     we need a variable to represent an integer. We define a base variety that is a point {\tt pt}
     containing this variable.

  Consequences
    X has dimension n (if n is present; else 0) and has symbols p,q... defined in its Chow ring (if they are present.
    A is a  bundle defined on X with rank r and Chern classes a_1..a_r (if this option is present).
  Description
   Text
     The symbols p,q... can be used as integer variables in Chow ring computations

     Y = projectiveSpace(3,X,VariableName => H)
     f = Y.StructureMap

     y = chern f_*OO_Y((f^*(p*a_1))+q*H)
     x == y

     Chern classes of an abstract sheaf are computed.  If called with

     {\tt chern} may also be called without one or both of these integer
     arguments, in which case just one Chern class, or the total Chern
     class is returned, respectively.
     In the following example, we consider two vector bundles
     {\tt A} and {\tt B} of ranks 2 and 3, respectively, on a variety

     Example using Schubert2
  Description
   Text
	There are d+1 conditions for a line to be
	contained in a general hypersurface of degree d in $\PP^n$.
	The Grassmannian of lines in $\PP^n$ has dimension 2(n-1).  Therefore,
	when d+1=2(n-1), we should expect a finite number of lines.
	Here is a way of computing the number using {\em Schubert2}.  In the case
	of lines on a quintic hypersurface in $\PP^4$, this computation was done
	by Hermann Schubert in 1879.

	We will first illustrate the method by computing the number
	of lines on a cubic surface in $\PP^3$.

	We first construct @ofClass AbstractVariety@ representing
	the Grassmannian of lines in $\PP^3$ with its tautological sub-
	and quotient bundles.
   Example
     G = flagBundle({2,2}, VariableNames => {,c})
     (S,Q) = G.Bundles
   Text
	Any cubic surface is given by a cubic form on $\PP^3$,
	that is, an element of the third symmetric power of the
	space of linear forms, which is the trivial rank 4 bundle
	on $\PP^3$.  Its image in the third symmetric power
	{\tt symmetricPower(3,Q)}  of the
	quotient bundle {\tt Q} vanishes at those points of the
	Grassmannian that correspond to lines on which the
	cubic form vanishes identically, that is, lines
	contained in the cubic surface.  The class of this
	locus is the top Chern class of this bundle.
   Example
	B = symmetricPower(3,Q)
	c = chern(rank B,B)
	integral c
   Text
	We can do the same thing for any n, (with d=2n-3) as
	follows:
   Example
	f = n->(G = flagBundle({n-1,2}); integral chern(symmetricPower(2*n-3,(G.Bundles)_1)))
	for n from 2 to 8 do print( time f(n))
	time f 20
   Text
	Note: In characteristic zero, using Bertini's theorem,
	the numbers computed can be proved to be equal
	to the actual numbers of distinct lines 
	for general hypersurfaces.  In $\PP^3$, every smooth cubic
	surface in characteristic zero has exactly 27 lines.
	In higher dimensions there may be smooth hypersurfaces for which
	the number of lines is different from the "expected" number
	that we have computed above.
	For example, the Fermat quintic threefold has an infinite number
	of lines on it.

     Example using Schubert2
  Description
   Text
     The number of conics (rational curves of degree 2) on a general
     quintic hypersurface in $\PP^4$ was computed by S. Katz in 1985.  Here
     is how the computation can be made with {\em Schubert2}.

     Any conic in $\PP^4$ spans a unique plane, and the conics in a plane correspond to the points
     of $\PP^5$.  Hence the space of conics in
     $\PP^4$ is a certain $\PP^5$-bundle $X$ over the Grassmannian $G$ of planes in $\PP^4$.
   Example
     G = flagBundle{2,3}
     (S,Q) = G.Bundles        -- (Q is the rank 3 tautological quotient bundle)
     B = symmetricPower(2,Q)  -- (the bundle of quadratic forms on the variable plane)
   Text
     As a matter of convention, a {\em projective bundle} constructed by the function @ TO projectiveBundle @
     in {\em Schubert2} parametrizes 
     rank 1 quotients of the sheaf provided.  The $\PP^5$-bundle of conics is given by sublinebundles of $B$, or
     equivalently, by rank 1 quotients of the dual, $B^*$, as in the following code:
   Example  
     X = projectiveBundle(dual B, VariableNames => {,{z}})
   Text
     The equation of the general quintic is a section of the fifth symmetric
     power of the space of linear forms on $\PP^4$.  The induced equation on any given
     conic is an element in the corresponding closed fiber of a certain vector
     bundle $A$ of rank 11 on the parameter space $X$.  On any given plane $P$,
     and for any conic $C$ in $P$, we get the following exact sequence:
	   $$ 0 \to{} H^0(O_P(3)) \to{} H^0(O_P(5)) \to{} H^0(O_C(5)) \to{} 0$$
     As $C$ varies, these sequences glue to a short exact sequence of bundles on $X$:
	   $$ 0 \to{} Symm^3 Q \otimes O(-z) \to{} Symm^5 Q \to{} A \to{} 0$$
     We compute the class of $A$ in the Grothendieck group:
   Example
     A = symmetricPower_5 Q - symmetricPower_3 Q ** OO(-z)
   Text
     A given conic is contained in the quintic if and only if the equation of the
     quintic vanishes identically on the conic.  Hence the class of the locus of
     conics contained in the quintic is the top Chern class of $A$.  Hence
     the number of them is the integral of this Chern class:
   Example
     integral chern A
