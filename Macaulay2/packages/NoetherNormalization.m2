--However, lemma 3.2 only works if the ideal is prime and we never actually test for this (and probably shouldn't).

--homogeneous stuff
--do we have an input option for the homogeneous case or do we always use the homogeneous program on homogeneous ideals?
--how do we do the linear change of variables if they have some weird weighting on the variables?

--isHomogeneous works on rings and ideals and elements
--use gb(...,Algorithm => Homogeneous2)
--homogenize(m,v) m ring element, v variable
--degree(v,m) v variable, m ring element, degree of m with respect to v

--========================================================
--dan example
-- 1. use information about variables integral, algebraic, and other and put them in this ordering and then try it.
-- 2. is lex only used for varprep
-- 3. ps, man ps or top tells how long it takes, shell command called time also
-- 4. or just stop singular from printing
-- gbTrace


-- TO DO:
-- clear up output
-- get randomness
-- implement for nonprime ideals

-- Ok as far as the not prime case is concerned, let's write it as follows:
-- 
-- We'll do it with 3 routines.
-- 
-- noetherDecider
--         Will output T, and decided with algoritm to use.
--
-- noetherPrime
--        Will utilize the T being outputted
--
-- noetherNotPrime
--     	  Will also use T being outputted.
