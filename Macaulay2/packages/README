Advice to authors of Macaulay2 packages:

Since Macaulay2 is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), and
your package will be distributed as part of Macaulay2, your software must be
licensed compatibly.  

One possibility is for the your software to be put into the public domain.  In
that case, you may adapt a brief license statement from the following model,
and insert it as a comment in your file.

   {*

   This program is in the public domain.
   *}

Alternatively, you may consider licensing your software under the GPL.

Macaulay2 is currently licensed under GPL version 2, and soon also under GPL
version 3, so it is preferable for authors of Macaulay2 packages who wish not
to put their code into the public domain, is to license it under GPL version 2
or any later version.
