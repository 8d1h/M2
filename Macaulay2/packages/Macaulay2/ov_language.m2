     A good example is ", TO "#", " which binds as tightly as ", TO ".", "
     when used as an infix operator, and binds as loosely as adjacency or
     function application when used as a prefix operator.",

     the level will be set to 1 less than the precedence of an identifier,
     so that ", TT "b c d", " will be parsed as ", TT "b (c d)", ".",
