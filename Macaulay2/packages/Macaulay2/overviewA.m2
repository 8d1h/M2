     "Macaulay 2 differs from other computer algebra systems such as 
     Maple and Mathematica, in that before making a polynomial, 
     you must create a ring to contain it, deciding first
     the complete list of indeterminates and the type of coefficients 
     permitted.  Recall that a ring is a set with addition and multiplication operations 
     satisfying familiar axioms, such as the distributive rule.  
     Examples include the ring of integers (", TO "ZZ", "), the
     ring of rational numbers (", TO "QQ", "), and the most 
     important rings in Macaulay 2, polynomial rings.",
