Never mind the earlier bug with hilbertSeries/projectiveHilbertPolynomial.

Note: the main page for "poincare" says:

(cokernel f).cache.poincare = p -- inform the system that the Poincare
polynomial of the cokernel of f is p. This can speed the computation
of a Groebner basis of f. For details, see computing Groebner bases.

Mike said this ought to be changed as well as mentioned on the gb
page, but needs to be checked out or updated first so I'm leaving it
as is right now.
