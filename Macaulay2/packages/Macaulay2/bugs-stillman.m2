quotients

elimination

gb of a monomial ideal (over a poly ring or quotient by monomials)
  should not recompute the GB.
MonomialIdeal : RingElement now computes horrendous amount.  It
  should call immediately the monomial ideal code.  If the ring element
  is not a monomial, it should still call the monideal code, using the
  monomial ideal of all terms of a polynomial.
hilbert series of a monomial ideal should be using monideal code.

-- 1/25/06 Questions and issues for Dan
'local', 'global', 'symbol'.  Is 'global' different from 'symbol'?
readme file for linux
match up the 'getting started' page with the readme's?
classic mode
emacsPath?
For me: remove missing node/extra node doc nodes.
linking to doc pages in another package.

in order to statically link on macaulay.math.cornell.edu (linux), I need to add
  in the -latlas.  Let's put this or something else in more globally...
  -- use --with-lapacklibs=
in capybara: get conflicts with packages on macaulay.math.cornell.edu
same in M2 after doing 'installPackage "Macaulay2"'
where do I upload files to have them on our website?
I would like the Dmodule package in the dist, if possible?  is this easy?

operators: which are active?  precedence?  which can have methods installed?
also: under linux, example files can be built in short time, so make sure that
  we redo them all.
