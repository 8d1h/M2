--- status: Draft
--- author(s): Amelia Taylor
--- notes: This is a new file bringing together both prune and minPres as a 
---        complete minimal presetation collection.  trim is inherently 
---        different as it minimizes to the extent possible while preserving
---        the ambient module.
