     "As we see in the example, an irreducible characteristic series
     for ", TT "I", " consists of a collection of triangular sets. Here,

     largest variable appearing in ", TEX "f", " (with respect to the lexicographic order).
     In the example, ", TEX "lvar(-w*y+z^2) = w", " . A triangular set consists
     of polynomials ", TEX "f_1, ... , f_r", " such that ", TEX "lvars(f_1)< ... < lvars(f_r)", ".
     In the example, ", TEX "lvar(-x*y^2+z^3) =x < w = lvar(-w*y+z^2)", " . If ",
     TEX "T_1, ... ,T_s", " form an irreducible characteristic series for ", TT "I", " , and if
     ", TEX "J_i", " is the ideal generated by the largest variables of the
     elements of ", TEX "T_i", " , then the algebraic set ", TEX "V(I)", " 
     defined by ", TT "I", " is the union of the ", TEX "(V(T_i) \\setminus V(I_i))", " . 
     The minimal associated primes of  ", TT "I", " can, thus, be recovered from the
     irreducible characteristic series by saturation (and by throwing
