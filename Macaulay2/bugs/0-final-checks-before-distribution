things to do manually before release

       fix bugs

       add test files

       run ldd M2 to see that we don't depend on any of our own sharable libraries (yet)

       check that readline and history and name completion work in an xterm

       look at html documentation 

       look at info documentation

       try viewHelp

       try viewHelp res, etc.

       update Macaulay2/man/M2.1.in

       check that getPackage works for all the packages available

       test *.rpm files

       test *.deb files

       test *.tar.gz file

       test freebsd *.tbz package

       check that alarm works or devise an automated test

       check that installPackage works for the user (now, with no symbolic links)
       	     and that it creates a documentation database and finds and uses it

       check that installPackage "Macaulay2Doc" works

       try edit(dim,Module), in emacs under X and in emacs in an xterm

       verify that ~/.Macaulay2/README is restored if it is deleted

       run M-x Info-validate on the info file

       make sure the links in the html documentation work

       run "make -k check" and check the output
