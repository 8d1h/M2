If I run the debug version under gdb and try

   prune image random(ZZ^2,ZZ^2)

once or twice then I invariably get a segmentation fault in 

     _ntl_gscompare (a=0xbd703827, b=0) at g_lip_impl.h:1188

Could you see if you have that problem and can shed any light on it?

I've checked in the changes.
