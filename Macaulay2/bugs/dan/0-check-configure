It's been a while since I've run the configure script in an environment
where all the libraries are already installed.  To test the configure script in
such an environment, I should run it after all the libraries are built with

      M2/BUILD/u123/normal/libraries/final/usr/lib/Macaulay2/Core/lib/

      M2/BUILD/u123/normal/libraries/final/usr/lib/Macaulay2/Core/include/

visible!

I'll add that test as part of "make check".
