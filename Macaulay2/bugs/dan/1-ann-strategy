I hope you don't mind if I merge ann and ann' and add a Strategy option.  Are
Iterative and Total descriptive words?

document { 
     Key => {ann', (ann',Module)},
     Headline => "an alternate algorithm for the annihilator ideal",
     Usage => "ann' M",
     "See ", TO annihilator, " for usage, description, and example."
     }
