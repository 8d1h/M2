The example files produced during installPackage (*.m2, *.out) need not be
installed or retained.  So, we should rewrite installPackage so it has the
concept of

	srcDirectory
	buildDirectory			example files are put here
	encapDirectory
	installDirectory

We could even create *all* the files in the buildDirectory, so the install step
just copies files.

The buildDirectory could in /tmp or somewhere...

Or better, get "capture" working!
