things to do manually before release

	interactive input behaviour
	try each of these, both in emacs (--no-readline) and in an xterm (with readline)
	follow each of them with a simple expression (e.g., "4"), to see if parsing has recovered
	   multiple statments per line:
	   	1;2;3
		1;2+;3
		1;2+ RETURN 3				??
	   interrupts:
		///asdf RETURN CTRL-C
		"asdf RETURN CTRL-C
		1 + RETURN CTRL-C
		{* RETURN CTRL-C
	   blank lines
		///asdf RETURN RETURN
		"asdf RETURN RETURN
		1 + RETURN RETURN
		{* RETURN RETURN
	   comments
	   	-- foo RETURN 4
	   	-- foo RETURN 4+ RETURN 5

	fix bugs

	add test files

	run ldd M2 or otool -L M2 in ...your-build-tree.../StagingArea/x86_64-MacOS-10.5/bin/
		 to see that we don't depend on any of our own sharable libraries (yet),
		 or on any libraries installed in nonstandard locations, such as in /sw/lib
	    do the same in ...your-build-tree.../StagingArea/x86_64-MacOS-10.5/libexec/Macaulay2/x86_64-MacOS-10.5/
		 for all the programs we compile and distribute

	check that readline and history and name completion work in an xterm

	look at html documentation 

	look at info documentation

	try viewHelp

	try viewHelp res, etc.

	update Macaulay2/man/M2.1.in

	check that getPackage works for all the packages available

	test *.rpm files

	test *.deb files

	test *.tar.gz file

	test freebsd *.tbz package

	check that alarm works or devise an automated test

	check that installPackage works for the user (now, with no symbolic links)
	      and that it creates a documentation database and finds and uses it

	check that installPackage "Macaulay2Doc" works

	try edit(dim,Module), in emacs under X and in emacs in an xterm

	verify that ~/.Macaulay2/README is restored if it is deleted

	run M-x Info-validate on the info file

	make sure the links in the html documentation work

	run "make -k check" and check the output

	make sure the macos x readme file is up to date

	test SCSCP:
	    A. Start a server in one M2 process
		 i1 : loadPackage "SCSCP";
		 i2 : startServer();						 
		 [SCSCP][Server] Listening on :26133
	    B. Test the server from another M2 process:
		 i1 : loadPackage "SCSCP";
		 i2 : s = newConnection "localhost"
		 o2 = SCSCP Connection to Macaulay2 (0.1) on localhost:26133
		 i3 : s <== openMath 1+2
		 o3 = 3
	    A. Try to stop the server by typing a Ctrl-C on the first process
		 [SCSCP][Server] Listening on :26133
		 [SCSCP][Server] Incoming connection. Forking.
