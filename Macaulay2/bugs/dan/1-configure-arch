currently 'configure', with no arguments, fails on the Mac because NTL compiles
itself for 64 bit, incompatibly.

1) control what NTL does, somehow

2) it should be easy to select 32 or 64 bit compilation with 'configure'.

3) make disable-fc-lib-ldflags the default on Mac, because with veclib
framework we don't need fortran libraries, and something fails.
