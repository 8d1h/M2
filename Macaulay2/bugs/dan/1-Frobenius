Subject: Frobenius

I was thinking of another procedure that would be nice to have in M2,
namely the Frobenius functor over rings of polynomials of characteristic
p. Maybe that's a;ready in, but I am not aware of that.

What I mean is: R=ZZ/p[vars], M=R-module, S=R with usual left R-action and
Frobenius right R-action. Then F(M)=S\otimes M. I.e., r^p\otimes m =
1\otimes rm.

It would be nice to be able to evaluate F(M). If M=R/I, it would be nice
to have a procedure that returns the map F(R/I) -> R/I. (I don't know if
M2 has "Map" as a class.)
