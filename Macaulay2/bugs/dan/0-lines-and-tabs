an undocumented feature of "lines" is that it translates tabs into spaces.

Probably I did that so something like

	stack lines foo

would come out looking reasonable when indented (?).

A work-around is to replace

	lines

by

	separate_"\n"

but maybe we want to fix "lines" so it doesn't do that.  (?)
