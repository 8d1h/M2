This should not give an error.  Instead it should produce something reasonable.

    i41 : netList({{"a","b"}},BaseRow => 1)
    stdio:41:1:(1):[0]: netList: base row out of bounds

Here's what it would do otherwise:

    i42 : netList({{"a","b"},{"a","b"}},BaseRow => 1)

	  +-+-+
	  |a|b|
	  +-+-+
    o42 = |a|b|
	  +-+-+

So maybe this would be okay:

    i42 : netList({{"a","b"}},BaseRow => 1)

	  +-+-+
	  |a|b|
	  +-+-+
    o42 =
