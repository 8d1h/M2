Another change that would be good: The doc on the website should be changed to 0.9.95.

web site: probably we don't need the "some chapters online" section of the book, since in one click you get to anyway.

More notes about the website: Some of the entries in "Other downloads" are not current"

In "Related links" section: several of the links are dead
