Sure, that sounds like fun.  I don't know the algorithm, though.  Let's see:
x=r/s mod p means sx=r mod p means sx-r+kp=0, so we take the vectors (s,r,k)
such that sx+r1+kp=0; they form a lattice of rank 2 in ZZ^3, and we pick a
vector of minimal length, perhaps using LLL, except that might be slow.  Is
that it?  Actually, we don't care how big k is, so we should pick a norm on Z^3
such as |(s,r,k)| = p^e s^2 + p^e r^2 + k^2, for some suitably large e.  Also,
we much prefer integer lifts, so we could make large s worse than large r by choosing a
norm like |(s,r,k)| = p^e s^2 + p^f r^2 + k^2 where e>f>1.

Failure is not possible, we can always lift to something.

By the way, lifting QQ --> RRR or RR can be done with continued fractions.  We
should do that, too.
