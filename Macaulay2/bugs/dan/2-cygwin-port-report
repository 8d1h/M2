Dear Macaulay2 Developers,

Just thought I would let you know that I have built
Macaulay2 to run with SAGE (using W Stein's Macaulay2-
2006-08-26.spkg) under Cygwin. I had to
export CPPFLAGS="-D_setmode=setmode"
before building in order for this to work.
I also ran "make check" afterward, and that completed
with one error (unfortunately, I forgot to bring the
error report with me to work today).

I hope this is of some help to you and others using
Macaulay2 on the Windows platform.
