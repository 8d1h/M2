This use of getGlobalSymbol is not documented:


    i11 : getGlobalSymbol "asdfasdf"
    stdio:7:1:(3): error: attempted to create symbol in protected dictionary

    i12 : getGlobalSymbol "sin"

    o12 = sin

    o12 : Symbol

Also, point out that if the symbol is known to exist, or should be made to
exist at parsing time, then

      global sin

is better.
