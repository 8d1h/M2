Here's code that monitors every call to any method function of random, which should be incorporated into "on"

debug Core
scan( methods random, x -> (
	  f := lookup x;
	  assert( f =!= null );
	  g := y -> (f opts) y;
	  setAttribute(g,ReverseDictionary,symbol random);
	  g = on g;
	  installMethod append (x,opts -> y -> (<< "random" << drop(x,1) << " : " ; g y) );
	  ))
dictionaryPath = select(dictionaryPath, d -> d =!= Core#"private dictionary")
