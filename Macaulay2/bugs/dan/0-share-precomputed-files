For sage and other builders of Macaulay2, it would be very nice if
./BUILD/share were to contain all the precomputed architecture independent
files normally built, so that we could include those files in a (bulky) source
distribution.  That would make the documentation for StatePolytope and
FourTiTwo uniform, i.e., the example output would be there, as run on some
other machine.

    Makefile
        all :: a.out
	a.out : a.m2 | M2
       

See 

    (make)Top:: > *Note Rules:: > Prerequisite Types

in make.info

-- in progress, notes:

fix package loading so all files are found whether they were installed with SeparateExec or not

fix installPackage so it doens't clobber the source file if it's in the same location as where it will get installed

note: perhaps the architecture dependent directory should not be in the staging
area at all, because the libraries might get built with debugging options in
some build trees.  Yes, so installPackage needs an option call
InstallExecPrefix in addition to InstallPrefix, and we can eliminate the option
SeparateExec.  We can get rid of the suffixes x86_64-Linux-Ubuntu-8.10 and
common, too, and have just one Layout once again.
