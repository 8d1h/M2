document setup() better, and discourage expert users from using it

PS: Or better yet, maybe setup() and setupEmacs() should always display the
proposed changes and prompt the user for permission to proceed.

fix the message so it says append/insert/create, as appropriate
offer experts the chance to make symbolic links to M2 and mention which directories are suitable
figure out a way for the user to get the info dir file built, check whether dir entries are made, whether dir is writable.
