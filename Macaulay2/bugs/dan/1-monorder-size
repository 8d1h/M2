Subject: Re: monomial orders
Reply-to: dan@math.uiuc.edu


Oh, right.  We would like an option like MonomialSize => n in the MonomialOrder
list to apply to subsequent options as a default, until overriden by another
one.  It would be important to document which ones it applies to.

    i21 : apropos "Small"

    o21 = {GRevLexSmall, LexSmall}

    o21 : List

Does the list above imply it would apply only to GRevLex and Lex?

Shall I implement that now at top level?  (I assume yes.)

Do we get rid of the words with Tiny and Small in them now?
