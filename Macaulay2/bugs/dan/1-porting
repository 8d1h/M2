We got a new computer in our department, that I will probably be  
kicking in 10-15 grand on.

octopus.math.cornell.edu.  Get to it as with mathvader's.

specs: 8 dual core AMD-64 opteron's
128 GB RAM  (!!)

Let's get M2 running on it!  If you get a chance to make sure that our
mathvader build situation is current (capybara and M2 using svn),  
that would be great.
I can do it too, but you set it up initially, and can probably do it  
much faster than me.
Then let's run the tests.  Once that is done, I'll try out some big  
problems.
