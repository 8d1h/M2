It seems that int64_t is not defined in /usr/include/stdint.h.

Here's how it looks here:

    # if __WORDSIZE == 64
    typedef long int                int64_t;
    # else
    __extension__
    typedef long long int           int64_t;
    # endif

Let me know whether that helps.

** I should check for that in the configure script. **
