The problem is that we search for symbols along the list of dictionaries that
is the value of dictionaryPath , and the dictionary containing the user's
symbol Schubert2 is in front of the dictionary containing the package's symbol
Schubert2.

Work around it like this (on line 3) with:

   viewHelp Package$Schubert2

Here Package$Schubert2 is the synonym of the package's symbol Schubert2 that we
have chosen to allow you to access it unambiguously.

In the future, we should : (1) put the package symbols at the head of the list
; (2) alert the user to the shadowing.
