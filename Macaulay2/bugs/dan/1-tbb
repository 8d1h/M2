Could you add the intel threading building blocks (tbb) to capybara?
I'm playing around with several ways to parallelize code: pthreads
(low level), openmp (for arrays, basically), and tbb.  They can all be
used in the same program too.  pthreads seems to be available on the
machines we are interested in.  openmp comes in gcc 4.3, but also in
macosx gcc-4.2, and tbb needs to be built from source.  It appears to
be GPL ver 2 as well....

Here is one URL:
