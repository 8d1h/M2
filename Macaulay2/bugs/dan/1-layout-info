I think the reason I chose info instead of share/info is because that's where
emacs puts all of its info files.  But I agree that share/info is more logical,
because the stuff sort of belongs in "share".

I prefer to switch rather than to obey the autoconf directives, because it
would be quicker for me.  

Or, if I obey them, I should also obey the ones that tell me where to put the
shared libraries and the man files.

One problem with obeying the directive is that its value isn't guaranteed to
begin with the prefix, and I want to be able to generate a directory tree that
can be tarred up.

Hmm...
