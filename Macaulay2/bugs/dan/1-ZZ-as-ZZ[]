OK, This would be a good excuse for me to go ahead and start using rawPromote
for matrices, which you have made work.  The sooner I get that implemented, the
better.  Maybe I'll spend a good part of the day on promote and lift.

It will be a little confusing that the gb we're caching is over a different
ring.  Every time we access it to get gens, mingens, change matrix, I'll have
to lift the matrix from ZZ[] to ZZ.  It's more bookkeeping, but the front end
is good at bookkeeping.
