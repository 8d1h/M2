Add an option in some future version of Macaulay2 that would allow the degrees
ring to be given variable names by the user.  The lines to look at in ofcm.m2
are these:

    	  M.degreesRing = (
	       if opts.Heft =!= null
	       then degreesRing opts.Heft
	       else degreesRing degrk {* shouldn't really be needed *}
	       );
