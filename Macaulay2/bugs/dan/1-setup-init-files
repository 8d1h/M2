Subject: setting up .emacs
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 2006 15:51:48 -0400

Remember the idea we had the other day:

One would call a routine in M2 which would help set up .profile,  
or .bashrc, or .emacs...

Your emailer keeps wrapping.

That looks fine, but we need markers so that the new routine I write for fixing
up .emacs will see that.  Let's change it to

;; Macaulay 2 start

(setq load-path
       (append
        '( "/capybara/encap/Macaulay2-0.9.20/share/emacs/site-lisp/" )
        load-path
        ))

(load "M2-init.el" t)

; comment out the following line with an initial semicolon if you 
; want to use your f12 key for something else
(global-set-key [ f12 ] 'M2)

;; Macaulay 2 end

Yup, that's all in dan/1-setup-init-files already, and will be done.

I was thinking of having just one function that sets up .emacs, .login, and
.profile.

Perhaps it should be called "setup" or "init" or "setupInitializationFiles".

Okay, as the same thing might be a problem with X Windows.  We could do the
same with .cshrc.

C shells read .login and Bourne shells read .profile.

On the mac, LD_LIBRARY_PATH isn't used.

But basically, this sounds like a good idea.
