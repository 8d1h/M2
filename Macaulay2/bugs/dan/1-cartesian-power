Hi Dan,
I've found what is just at most a small issue, but it's making my code less
nice right now.

s = set{a,b,c}
s^**2 returns a set of sequences {(a,a),(a,b), ...}
as does s^**n for any n>1
however s^**1 just returns the set, ie. {a,b,c}
not a set of sequences like you would expect {(a),(b),(c)}. Is this how it's
meant to be?
Thanks,
Nat
