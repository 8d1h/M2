Totally reform our licensing and copyright language to follow the suggests on
the GNU GPL web site.

Ask authors of compiled code if we can update our license to GPL v3 or later.
(Mike says yes.  What about Anton, Franziska, ... ?)  Then Mike and I will
update to GPL v2 or v3.

State in the packing materials that the packages have independent licenses, and
Macaulay2 is an aggregate.
