having "export" accept a string instead of a symbol would be good, because then
a symbol could be created in the package dictionary, distinct from any symbol
already existing in the core.

    i1 : newPackage "Foo"

    o1 = Foo

    o1 : Package

    i2 : export { "asfd" }
    stdio:2:1:(1):[0]: expected a symbol: asfd
