OK, I installed g77 and bison and flex and reconfigured,
and the compilation finished (with many errors flashing by).

A make -k check gives many errors and "assertion failed" complaints.
Again -k. Maybe this is a developer-only test. But if the idea is
that users compile source and test the result to see whether they
got a working M2 system, there should not be a single error.
(Or at most errors that are prefixed by an explanatory text.)
Any fatal error should halt the check.
