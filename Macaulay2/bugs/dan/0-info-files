links don't quite work:

  - in a package Foo, links to Foo should be redirected to Top

  - links of the form

    	  *note foo:bar.

    might work better with a space in them

    	  *note foo: bar.

This kind of menu item goes to a line number in a node:

  * c-mode-hook:                           Program Modes.       (line  45)

Maybe we can use it.

The last link below just looks silly:  we can have more characters as part of
the visible name of the link, and it looks like there are two links:

    File: Macaulay2Doc.info, Node: syz_lpMatrix_rp, Next: Syzygies, Prev: syz_lpGroebnerBasis_rp, Up: Top

    syz(Matrix) -- compute the syzygy matrix
    ****************************************

    Synopsis

      * Inputs:
	  * h, a matrix  (*note matrix:Matrix.), a matrix
      * Outputs:
	  * a matrix  (*note matrix:Matrix.), the matrix of minimal or trimmed
	    generators for the syzygies among the columns of h
      * Optional inputs  (*note Optional inputs:using functions with optional
	inputs.):
	  * Algorithm => default value Inhomogeneous, see "gb(..., Algorithm =>
	    ...)"  (*note gb_lp..._cm Algorithm => ..._rp::)
