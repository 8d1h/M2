links don't quite work:

  - in a package Foo, links to Foo should be redirected to Top

  - in the node for Ideal, the link to "content" is broken,
    probably because it's redirected to "content_lpRingElement_rp".
    It needs to be a more complex link.

This menu item is bad because there is a colon on the left side:

    * Parser : Analyzer: Parser _co Analyzer.  combine a parser with a lexical
      analyzer to make a complete system

This menu item looks terrible on the screen:

	  * Algorithm => default value Inhomogeneous, see "gb(..., Algorithm =>
	    ...)"  (*note gb_lp..._cm Algorithm => ..._rp::)

--

This kind of menu item goes to a line number in a node:

  * c-mode-hook:                           Program Modes.       (line  45)

Maybe we can use it.
