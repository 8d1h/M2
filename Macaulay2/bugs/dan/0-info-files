links don't quite work:

  - in a package Foo, links to Foo should be redirected to Top

  - in the node for Ideal, the link to "content" is broken,
    probably because it's redirected to "content_lpRingElement_rp".
    It needs to be a more complex link.

This kind of menu item goes to a line number in a node:

  * c-mode-hook:                           Program Modes.       (line  45)

Maybe we can use it.
