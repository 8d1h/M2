The problem with the missing documentation is that for a ring, various
methods are installed; and the documentation maker insists that
methods applicable to things exported be documented.  But those
methods are uninteresting, as they are sort of the same for every
ring, so they don't really have to be documented.  Try declaring them
uninteresting, as in the code below.

Eventually we should fix that so it happens automatically for you.

newPackage "problem"
export { mySpecialRing }
mySpecialRing = QQ[x,y]
undocumented {
   (expression,mySpecialRing),
   (factor,mySpecialRing),
   (isPrime,mySpecialRing),
   (lift,List,mySpecialRing,mySpecialRing),
   (lift,List,mySpecialRing,QQ),
   (lift,List,mySpecialRing,ZZ),
   (lift,Matrix,mySpecialRing,mySpecialRing),
   (lift,Matrix,mySpecialRing,QQ),
   (lift,Matrix,mySpecialRing,ZZ),
   (lift,mySpecialRing,mySpecialRing),
   (lift,mySpecialRing,QQ),
   (lift,mySpecialRing,ZZ),
   (symbol ?,mySpecialRing,mySpecialRing),
   (promote,List,mySpecialRing,mySpecialRing),
   (promote,List,QQ,mySpecialRing),
   (promote,List,ZZ,mySpecialRing),
   (promote,Matrix,mySpecialRing,mySpecialRing),
   (promote,Matrix,QQ,mySpecialRing),
   (promote,Matrix,ZZ,mySpecialRing),
   (promote,mySpecialRing,mySpecialRing),
   (promote,QQ,mySpecialRing),
   (promote,ZZ,mySpecialRing)
   }
