new option behavior for monoid[...]

Heft	       		    if no Heft vector is given one will be computed with Fourier-Motzkin,
			    which should be pre-loaded.  If none exists, or the one given doesn't work (no error message given), we'll record that fact
			    and not use algorithms that depend on having one.

new options for R = A[...] and tensor(M,monoid[...],...)

DegreeMap => x->x	    provided Join=>false is given, specifies a function from lists of integers to lists of integers or integers that
	     		    transforms the degrees of the elements of A into their degrees in R.
			    If it returns a value too short, 0's will be silently appended.
			    If it returns a value too long, it will be an error.

Join => true		    specifies whether the new degrees are joined with the old degrees, ignoring the degree map.
     			    By default, the new heft vector will be obtained by joining the old ones.

ConstantCoefficients	    this option has been removed.  ConstantCoefficients=>false can be replaced by Join=>false

Warning: the monoid of R=A[...] is monoid[...] and not tensor(monoid
[...],monoid A).  To get the latter thing, the newly exported symbol FlatMonoid
is used in the expression R.FlatMonoid.

This should all be documented.

Also implement the interface for algebraic extensions of QQ.
