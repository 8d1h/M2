new options for monoid[...] and R = A[...]

DegreeMap => x->x	    specifies a function from lists of integers to lists of integers or integers that
	     		    transforms the degrees of the elements of A into their degrees in R.
			    If it returns a value too short, 0's will be silently appended.
			    If it returns a value too long, it will be an error.

JoinDegrees => true	    specifies whether the new degrees are joined with the old degrees

Heft	       		    if no Heft vector is given one will be computed with Fourier-Motzkin,
			    which should be pre-loaded.  If none exists, we'll record that fact
			    and not use algorithms that depend on having one.
