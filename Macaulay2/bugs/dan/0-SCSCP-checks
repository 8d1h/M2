Dan R points out :

    Some trivial security could be obtained by startServer "127.0.0.1" which starts
    a server that only binds to the "lo" interface, and therefore can only be
    connected to from the local machine.

so we can automate the SCSCP checks in 0-final-checks-before-distribution to some extent

We may also want "make insecure-check" as the target.
