I guess then I should put in a test for that positivity condition into res.m2,
and use it to decide whether to call the engine, so users don't see the message
below.  Umm, why did res coker vars R work?

    Macaulay 2, version 0.9.20
    with packages: Classic, Elimination, LLLBases, PrimaryDecomposition, SchurRings, TangentCone

    i1 : R = ZZ[x,y,Degrees => {1,-1}]

    o1 = R

    o1 : PolynomialRing

    i2 : res coker vars R

	  1      2      1
    o2 = R  <-- R  <-- R  <-- 0

	 0      1      2      3

    o2 : ChainComplex

    i3 : debug Core

    i4 : res coker random(R^2,R^{2,-2})
    stdio:4:11:(2):[2]: expected given degree vector to produce positive weights
