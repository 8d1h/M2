This is not so great because no checking against the disk is done:

    i1 : temporaryFileName ()

    o2 = /tmp/M2-1262-1

    i3 : temporaryFileName ()

    o3 = /tmp/M2-1262-2

    i4 : temporaryFileName ()

    o4 = /tmp/M2-1262-3

I've seen a collision!

Often one wants to create a collection of files, so they might was well all be
in the same directory.  Perhaps better would be a function that makes a new
temporary directory and returns the name of it.
