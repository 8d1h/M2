priority: low

currently a line is completely parsed and then evaluated

better would be to stop at each major semicolon and evaluate what's come so far

    i28 : load "/tmp/foo.m2";locate applicationDirectorySuffiX
    --warning: applicationDirectorySuffiX redefined

    o29 = (/tmp/foo.m2, 1, 37, 2, 40)

    o29 : Sequence

    i30 : get "/tmp/foo.m2"

    o30 =      applicationDirectorySuffiX = () -> (
		    if version#"operating system" === "Darwin"
		    then "Library/Application Support/Macaulay2/"
		    else ".Macaulay2/";
		    );
