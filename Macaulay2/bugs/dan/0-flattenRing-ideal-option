add an option for flattenRing so it will return an ideal instead of a quotient ring

perhaps
   Result => null
   	     QuotientRing
   	     Ideal

also, flattenRing Ideal => Ideal
      flattenRing Ring  => Ring

!

make sure flattenRing returns the map from the new ring to the old, so it works
when the new ring is the ambient ring and the map is the quotient ring
