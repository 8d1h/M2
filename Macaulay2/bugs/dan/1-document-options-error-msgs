for symmetricAlgebra, we have only these warnings:

    --warning: tag has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: symmetricAlgebra(..., Weights => ...), key [symmetricAlgebra, Weights]
    --warning: tag has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: symmetricAlgebra(..., MonomialOrder => ...), key [symmetricAlgebra, MonomialOrder]
    --warning: tag has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: symmetricAlgebra(..., Variables => ...), key [symmetricAlgebra, Variables]

but there are other options

    i2 : options symmetricAlgebra 

    o2 = OptionTable{DegreeRank =>                             }
		     Degrees => 
		     Global => true
		     Heft => 
		     Inverses => false
		     MonomialOrder => {GRevLex, Position => Up}
		     MonomialSize => 32
		     SkewCommutative => {}
		     VariableBaseName => p
		     Variables => 
		     Weights => {}
		     WeylAlgebra => {}

    o2 : OptionTable

and

in the html version of the documentation, all links to those options are missing from the page for symmetricAlgebra
