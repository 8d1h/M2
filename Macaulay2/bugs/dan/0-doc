If there is a ring stored as an output variable when help RingElement is called, then an error is raised.

    i66 : QQ[x]

    o66 = QQ[x]

    o66 : PolynomialRing

    i67 : help RingElement
    stdio:76:1:(3):[0]: error: package title not alphanumeric: ""

The problem is that it tries to mention the types that are types of RingElement, and o66 is one, but "package o66" returns null.
