Dear Dan and Mike,

Certainly I would not have expected that for a coherent sheaf!

There I would expect the Hilbert function of the global section module.
If the given underlying module M has depth >= 2, this is the same,
but not otherwise. The right function H(m) can be computed
for n > n_0, say, tas the Hilbert function of

Hom(mm^d, M),

where mm is the maximal homogeneous ideal and d is computed from
the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of M (as a module over a polynomial
ring.)

This is all a little complicated. Worth including "automatically"?

Regards,

David
