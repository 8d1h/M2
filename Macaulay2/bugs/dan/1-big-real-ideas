pi, ii, etc, should be a new type of Number called "Constant"

operations like this should be provided:

	   toRR 2.3
	   toCC 2.3
	   2.3 * pi
	   toRRR_200 pi

mpfr has a routine for computing pi accurately

make format(...) work for RRR and CCC:

     -4.33234234234p345e9
     -4.33234234234p345*10^9

make an input syntax for RRR numbers, namely:

     -4.33234234234p345e9
