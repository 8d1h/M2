Hi Dan,
factory assumes only, that the minimal polynomial of the field extension is
given as a irreducible polynomial.
(There is also another representation, which uses the root
of the multiplicative group, but we do not use it, so its untested.)
Here an example for gcd in a field extension of Z/p by mipo
(a polynomial of type CanonicalForm):
  setCharacteristic(p);
  Variable a=rootOf(mipo);
  // build F and G using a to represent a root of mipo
  return gcd(F,G);
for extentions of Q:
  setCharacteristic(0);
  CFList as(mipo);
  Variable a=rootOf(mipo);
  // build F and G using a to represent a root of mipo
  return  alg_gcd( F, G, as);
And factorization of G:
  setCharacteristic(p); // resp. setCharacteristic(0);
  Variable a=rootOf(mipo);
  // build G using a to represent a root of mipo
  CFFList L=Factorize(G, mipo);
