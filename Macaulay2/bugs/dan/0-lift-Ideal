write code to lift ideals in quotient rings to ambient rings

what do these do?

    i21 : methods (lift, Ideal)

    o21 = { (lift, Ideal, QQ)          }
	  { (lift, Ideal, RingElement) }
	  { (lift, Ideal, ZZ)          }

    o21 : VerticalList


also promote

maybe an option to specify how "far" to go
