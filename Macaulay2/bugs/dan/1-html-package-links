installPackage should use absolute paths for hyperlinks to packages 
installed with a different prefix.

Then we could stop making all those symbolic links in ~/.Macaulay2/local to the
installed packages.

An even better idea would be to abandon those symbolic links completely, and
when generating html while installing a package, to use absolute links for
everything that's outside the target tree.  That'll make the html non-portable,
but installing a package from source is easier than sending the whole thing
along with the html, anyway.

This'll have to wait until 1.1.1.
