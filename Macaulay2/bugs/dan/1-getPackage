This list could be improved:

    i20 : getPackage()

    o20 = {Dmodules, FirstPackage, LDL, StateTables, TestPackage}

    o20 : List

The packages web page could be improved, too!

(Add an option for listing the versions available.)

Set up a special part of our svn repository for contributors to that, and
automate the transfer of updates from the svn repository to the getPackages
repository.
