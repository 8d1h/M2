fixed:

--*- M2 -*--

    i6 : R = QQ[x,y]/(x^2-y^3)

    o6 = R

    o6 : QuotientRing

    i7 : f = map(frac R, QQ[t_0..t_2], {x/1,y/1,x/y})

					    x
    o7 = map(frac(R),QQ [t , t , t ],{x, y, -})
			  0   1   2         y

    o7 : RingMap frac(R) <--- QQ [t , t , t ]
				   0   1   2

    i8 : kernel f

    o8 = ideal(t t  - t )
		1 2    0

    o8 : Ideal of QQ [t , t , t ]
		       0   1   2

This is the wrong answer -- it seems to have ignored the relation between x and y, which should give a relation between t_0 and t_1.
