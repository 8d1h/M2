Some wrapping in info mode is still bad.  Let it flow over?

    * select(ZZ,BasicList,Function): select_lpZZ_cmBasicList_cmFunction_rp.  select
									     elemen

    more information
    * VisibleList::                 the class of all visible lists
    * BasicList::                   the class of all basic lists
     to each
    t
    o each



     of a list
    condition
     of a list
    condition


    irst element of a list
    ying a condition
    h elements of a list
    sfy a condition
    s from a list
     a limited number of
    ts from a list

Wrapping a headline like this is bad, too:

    select(ZZ,BasicList,Function) -- select a limited number of elements from a lis
    *******************************************************************************
    t
    *

There are other places we could have split it, and one character widows don't look good.
