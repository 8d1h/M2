Dear Macaulay developers!





For many algebraic problems, like matrix rank computation of a big 
Matrix over an finite field Macaulay routines could be much faster.


Let me give an example:

Recently i was asked by Dr. Matthias Schuett (Harward University ) and
Prof. v. Bothmer (University of Hannover) to compute the rank of 14.000
x 14.000 Matrix. They told me, that in Macaulay it would take too much
time. (rank computation of a 1.000x 1.000 dense matrix costs 80 seconds
on a common PC, so the same operation for a 14.000 x 14.000 Matrix
would cost approximately 50-90 Hours)

I implemented a 'naive' gaussian elimination and could solve the
described problem in just two hours. 

But there exists a better solution for this class of problems, namely
the FFLAS-FFPACK-Library (Finite field linear algebra subroutines).
Using this library the problem above was solved in 8 minutes!





So my opinion (and my concern) is:
It may be a good idea to integrate this library in the Macaulay-System.
