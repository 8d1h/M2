In the list of documentation warnings, there are some of the form:

--warning: tag has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: cauchy, key symbol cauchy
--warning: tag has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: extract, key symbol extract
--warning: tag has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: findNonMember, key symbol findNonMember
--warning: tag has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: flattener, key symbol flattener
--warning: tag has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: jacobiTrudiE, key symbol jacobiTrudiE
--warning: tag has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: minSat, key symbol minSat
--warning: tag has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: plethysmMap, key symbol plethysmMap

...

These are really defined in other packages (SchurRings,  
PrimaryDecomposition in particular).  It is true that they need to be  
documented there, but is there a link to them somewhere in the  
documentation? (Ah, probably the generated lists for Matrix , and  
similar types...).  The link should really be to: SchurRings::cauchy,  
etc...?
