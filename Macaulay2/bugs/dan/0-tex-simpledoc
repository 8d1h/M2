tex isn't getting formatted: we need a method for net(TEX), or ??

also, we should document which tex features are available, and show examples in SimpleDoc

can we restrict the use of ^ and _ to math mode?

There must be a way to do \rm in a nested way:

i30 : html TEX "$ x^2 { \\rm abc } y^2$ cde"

o30 = <i> x<sup>2</sup> abc  y<sup>2</sup></i> cde


    i36 : help "FourTiTwo"

    o36 = FourTiTwo -- Interface for 4ti2
	  *******************************



	  Description
	  ===========

	  Interfaces most of the functionality of the software {\tt 4ti2} available at  {\tt http://www.4ti2.de/}. (The user needs to have 4ti2 installed on
	  his/her machine.)

	  A {\tt d\times n} integral matrix {\tt A} (with nonnegative entries) specifies a map from a polynomial ring in d variables to a polynomial ring with n
	  variables by specifying exponents of the variables indexing its columns. For example, if {\tt A} is a matrix <br> 3 2 1 0<br> 0 1 2 3<br> the map from
	  {\tt k[s,t]} to {\tt k[a,b,c,d]} is given by <br> {\tt (s,t)-> (s^3, s^2t,st^2,t^3)}. <br>
