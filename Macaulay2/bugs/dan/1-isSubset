if M.relations == 0 or N.relations == 0 then this code could return "false" incorrectly!

Moreover, we don't need the whole gb if g is homogeneous!  That slows down the
first "trim I" in the test in gb-doc.m2.

Also, that test should have some assert statements in it.

    issub := (f,g) -> -1 === rawGBContains(raw gb g,raw f)

    o8 = -- code for method: isSubset(Module,Module)
	 -- ../m2/modules2.m2:644-654
	 isSubset(Module,Module) := (M,N) -> (
	      -- here is where we could use gb of a subquotient!
	      ambient M == ambient N and
	      if M.?relations and N.?relations then (
		   image M.relations == image N.relations
		   and
		   issub(M.relations | generators M, N.relations | generators N))
	      else if not M.?relations and not N.?relations then (
		   issub(generators M, generators N))
	      else false
	      )
