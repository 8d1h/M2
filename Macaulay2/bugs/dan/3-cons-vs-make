What is SCons?

SCons is an Open Source software construction tool\u2014that is, a
next-generation build tool. Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform
substitute for the classic Make utility with integrated functionality similar
to autoconf/automake and compiler caches such as ccache. In short, SCons is an
easier, more reliable and faster way to build software.

What is CONS?

    Do you use Makefiles for your project? Have you ever done a "make clean;
make all" just because you didn't know if the files you changed would be
rebuilt correctly? Or perhaps you work on several machines accessing an NFS
server, and if their clocks aren't in sync, make won't know to rebuild things?
Well, welcome to a new and better way to control the building of your projects.

    CONS is a replacement for MAKE. It is not compatible with make, but it has
a number of powerful capabilities not found in other software construction
systems, including make. It is distributed under the GNU General Public License
(GPL).

    CONS is implemented in Perl. You don't need to know Perl to use CONS,
although you can use it more powerfully if you do.  To use CONS, you will need
Perl 5.003 or better and the Perl Digest::MD5 module, available from CPAN
(Digest-MD5-*.tar.gz).

    CONS is known to work on a variety of platforms. It's in production use on
versions of AIX, FreeBSD, HPUX, IRIX, Linux, Solaris, SunOS, and Windows NT.
