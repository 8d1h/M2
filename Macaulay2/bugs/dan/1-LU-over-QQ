Thanks very much for your help with M2.

A more detailed list will come in a few days, but one thing that comes to
mind quickly, and that would be quite useful, is to have the LU
decomposition of matrices to work over QQ. It's already implemented for
ZZ/p, RR, and CC. The last two are apparently Lapack-based (so that's more
of a hassle), but I'm guessing the one over ZZ/p should not too bad to
adapt...

(this would probably also enable "Solve" to work in QQ)

Thanks in advance,
