In doc text like this:

    A random Macaulay 2 documentation node:

	* accumulate(Function,Thing,VisibleList) -- apply binary operator repeatedly

it would be better if there were spaces like this:

    A random Macaulay 2 documentation node:

	* accumulate(Function, Thing, VisibleList) -- apply binary operator repeatedly

so lines could wrap in narrow boxes on a web page.
