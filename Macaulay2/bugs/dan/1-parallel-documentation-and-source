Subject: Ben's bug: try this
Date: Fri, 25 Jan 2008 16:32:29 -0500

I looked at Ben's machine, and saw his bug.  It turns out I have the
same bug on my system.

Here is how to reproduce it:

(This assumes, perhaps, that you have run M2 on an older version, pre
1.0 (maybe even a bit older?).

Open M2
viewHelp
click on "FirstPackage" in your local copy of the documentation
(under .Macaulay2)
now click on the source code link: FirstPackage.m2
   It is not found!

For Ben, I moved the 'local' directory under .Macaulay2 out of the
way, and restarted M2.  This worked fine then, as then there was no
local copy of the documentation.
