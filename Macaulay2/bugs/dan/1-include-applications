Why not treat applications such as polymake, Normaliz, etc., as libraries, and just
download them, compile them, and include them in the distribution?

The configure script could detect whether the programs exist already, and find out
what package they came from, so as to construct the dependencies properly.  But
most of these aren't packaged yet.
