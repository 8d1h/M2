This is a common error:

    Say if I want to output numbers 0 to 9 to a file named ff, I use the
    following code:

     fn="/home/0/llpku/Desktop/ff"
     openOut(fn)
     scan(10,i->(fn<<i<<endl));
     fn<<close

    But the file ff turns out to contain only number 0. If convenient, could
    you please help me out? Thanks a lot!

Two ways to fix it:

    make fn<<i and fn<<close recover the current open file instead of opening a new one
    make fn<<i and fn<<close give an error message
