The link called "directory" at the top of this page:

http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.2/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_singular__Locus.html

is linked here:

file:///home/25/dan/.Macaulay2/index.html

I don't actually know how to fix this problem, because the relative path
between those two pages is variable, as it depends both on the location where
Macaulay2 was installed and on the path to the user's home directory.
