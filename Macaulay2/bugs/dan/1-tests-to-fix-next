Subject: some tests which fail
Date: Wed, 13 Sep 2006 10:42:57 -0400

Here are some tests which are potentially easier for you to fix:

clearOutput	-- fixed
frac		-- fixed
galois		-- this is Mike's now, see bugs/mike/1-subst
inhom		-- fixed
normal_test  (problem is map(frac R, frac R)  fails...)
order
ringmap3, might also be a problem for me...
subst3
typicalval

and also:

that D-module example that fails
