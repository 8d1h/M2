Subject: some tests which fail
Date: Wed, 13 Sep 2006 10:42:57 -0400

Here are some tests which are potentially easier for you to fix:

clearOutput	-- fixed
frac		-- fixed
galois		-- this is Mike's now, see bugs/mike/1-subst
		   okay, I will fix all Galois ring maps -- I give the engine where the primitive element should go
inhom		-- fixed
normal_test	-- fixed some things, now it's failing on a reducible example with too few rings returned
order		-- factory returns a different factorization the first time, even though I set the random number seeds
		   we should just sort the anwer
ringmap3	-- works now
subst3		-- this will work when we fix ring maps for Galois fields
typicalval

and also:

that D-module example that fails
