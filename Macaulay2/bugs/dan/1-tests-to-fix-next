Subject: some tests which fail
Date: Wed, 13 Sep 2006 10:42:57 -0400

Here are some tests which are potentially easier for you to fix:

clearOutput	-- fixed
frac		-- fixed
galois		-- fixed
inhom		-- fixed
normal_test	-- fixed some things, now it's failing on a reducible example with too few rings returned
order		-- factory returns a different factorization the first time, even though I set the random number seeds
		   we should just sort the anwer
ringmap3	-- fixed
subst3		-- fixed
typicalval	-- fixed

and also:

that D-module example that fails
