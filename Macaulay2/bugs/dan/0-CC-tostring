In printing complex numbers, we should go the distance to the right of the
point in both parts:

    i1 : 1e-30 + ii

    o1 = 1e-30+ii

    o1 : CC (of precision 53)

    i2 : printingPrecision

    o2 = 2

That part is done.

The same would apply to vectors, matrices, and the coordinates of points.

Do it for matrices before 1.1.
