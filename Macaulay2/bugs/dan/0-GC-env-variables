The relevant env variables seem to be (I have placed values in them, beacause I grabbed this from my debug script)

GC_PRINT_STATS=1 
GC_MAXIMUM_HEAP_SIZE=2000000000 
GC_INITIAL_HEAP_SIZE=1000000000 
GC_FREE_SPACE_DIVISOR=12 

I need to check, but it might be possible to change the first and last of these by program control.  That might be useful.

By the way, maybe this would be one way to get around the ulimit problem on the mac: set the max heap size first.
