Here is a little documentation bug:

I installed EdgeIdeals (there is also one in the version included with
M2), and go to its documentation.  I get to one of its pages, and then
click "top" to get to the top of its tree.  It lands me at the
EdgeIdeal doc page, but for the version originally coming with M2,
instead of the top page for itself...
