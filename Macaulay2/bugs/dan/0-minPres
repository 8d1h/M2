Subject: Re: bugs in minPres and regularity
Date: Thu, 24 Jul 2008 20:10:16 -0400

This is full of bugs, it seems!

1. minPres Me -- changes degrees as you say
2. regularity Me -- is NOT correct!?  Why does it not consider the  
degrees?  Probably because it is using minPres...

So maybe the behavior is explained by only one bug (which gives WRONG  
answers!).

I leave tomorrow morning for Ireland, so I'm not sure I can  debug it  
promptly.  Dan, could you look at minPres too?
