ideas:

introduce a new Type called Constant with instances pi, e, etc.

Granlund says gmp doesn't put pointers in memory it allocates, so we could use gc_static for it always

n-th root code in gmp is slow.  Perhaps Brent's method would be faster?

mpsolve is a package that finds roots of univariate polynomials quickly, use it?

use Noro's alg for gb over alg no flds?  See p. 99 in the ICMS book.

ideas from cocoa lib:
	Precompute a bit m mask for each monomial M with the property that M|M' implies m&~m'=0
	Implement real numbers as a pair of floats, initially with a small difference.  Perform
		computations in parallel, gauge accuracy by the difference.
