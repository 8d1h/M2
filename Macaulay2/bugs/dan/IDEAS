use Noro's alg for gb over alg no flds?  See p. 99 in the ICMS book.

ideas from cocoa lib:
	Precompute a bit m mask for each monomial M with the property that M|M' implies m&~m'=0
	Implement real numbers as a pair of floats, initially with a small difference.  Perform
		computations in parallel, gauge accuracy by the difference.

singular uses slibgb (Brickenstein).

official refereeing of packages (recognition for contributors)

produce doc in TeXmacs format!  Use it to make the book, instead of tex.

small computers: Sharp SLC 760, 1 kg, (Hammada has one)

Need an icon for M2 so it can be on a live Knoppix CD.  The accelerated version
