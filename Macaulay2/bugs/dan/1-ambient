A little problem: If we make "ambient R" return R when R is not a quotient
ring, then I think it might break some code internally, which, from a ring like
R/I/J/K will return R, and operates by applying "ambient" until an error
occurs.  Still, that internal code is stupid, and your suggestion sounds like a
good one ...
