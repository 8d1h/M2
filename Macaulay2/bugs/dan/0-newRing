Amelia: As far as I know, modifyRing (or newRing as it was once named) as it is
in the system does not work for us, but the modified version of it that is in
ReesAlgebra in the snowbird directory does.

newRing needs a DegreeMap option so it can keep matrices homogeneous

newRing should return a ring map to the new ring, optionally
