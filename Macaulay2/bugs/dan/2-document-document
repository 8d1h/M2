I am documenting pushForward, pushForward1.  However, I cannot  
remember how to get optional argument descriptions "inline".  I can't  
find it easily in the documentation either.  I also know that there  
is some function which is a good example of this, but I can't recall  
which!

Could you point me in the right direction?  We should also document  
this with the 'writing documentation' section.


--- this should be documented under [document,Inputs], too!
