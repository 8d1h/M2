Dan:

= -- mutability is an issue, assignment methods for operators can be installed, examples

GlobalReleaseHook needs a headline

take "operators" out of all of these nodes in the SeeAlso

:= -- examples, typical value with =>, function installMethod

<- -- the - is too tiny!, mutability for both, 
	bodily replacing -- do we need that still???  why?  is it really there?
	examples

	i47 : {1} <- {4}
	stdio:48:5:(2): '<-': no method for object on left

	i48 : (new MutableList from {1}) <- {4}
	stdio:49:28:(2): '<-': no method for object on left

	<- IndexedVariable should appear as IndexedVariable <- Thing in the ways to use list


== 	Inputs, Outputs, is the caveat about ? returning symbol== correct?, tainted by Macaulay2Core
	in some cases there is no method, and an error results

?	? for ideals?

!=	modern form

===	modern form, Thing===Thing should go here, too, it always gives an answer, with no error message

=!=	similar

>= ZZ	fix up

and	modern form, example
or
not


" "	some superfluous markup type items and expression items

	CoherentSheaf ZZ	missing usage
	WrapperType???

@@	is okay!

_	missing documentation

methods for normal forms...
	we need Synopsis to appear even if we aren't documenting a function!
	and give an error when we ignore one that's present


Option ++ Option what is that?

CohShf ^** ZZ 	examples
Module ^** ZZ	examples


Module ~	example				what about ~ for Spec R -- not really needed, because for affine varieties, it's an equivalence of categories!
Ideal ~		merge with Module ~
Ring ~		see also OO and Proj


(*)	write it

List >> Function -- merge with OptionTable >> Function and modernize a bit

List | List -- join the example boxes


=> 	direct Thing=>Thing here and rewrite with an example.

,	add text and example
