make package/Makefile run check P for each package P

new option for checking and running examples: whether to use capture or whether to run them in another process

use "capture" to run examples and check P, time the output, set an alarm, limit our own memory, too, with ulimit system call (can we reverse that?)

get rid of all of those cached example output and input files!
