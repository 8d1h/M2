F below looses its skew commutativity....
If you want, I can place this as a bug in your bugs directory.  But  
it might be a very fast fix...
(I ran across this trying to test resolutions over skew commutative  
rings)

kk=ZZ/101;
E=kk[y_0..y_6,SkewCommutative=>true]
E.?SkewCommutative
F=E/(y_0*y_1-y_2*y_3)
F.?SkewCommutative
