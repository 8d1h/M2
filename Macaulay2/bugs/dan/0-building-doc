Add this to a new node on documenting running from the build tree:

    (1) It makes a difference whether you are "installing" the absolute latest, or
    just running it in place, in the build directory.  If you are running from an
    installed M2, then prefixDirectory will have a nonnull value, like this:

	i1 : prefixDirectory

	o1 = /usr/

    I recently made a change so the viewHelp main index is updated when the build
    M2 starts running.  Naturally, it has no idea where the installed M2 is, so it
    can't index the documentation there.  The solution is to run your M2 with 

	   --prefix /usr/

    or something similar added to the command line.  Then, when indexing, it will
    know where the installed files are, too.  Recall that in emacs this can be done
    with C-U F12, which offers you the command line for editing.
