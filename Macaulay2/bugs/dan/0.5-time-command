under debian "install-info" might not be there: have configure check for it; it might be in /usr/sbin!

under cygwin all the tests might fail:

    testing: /home/root/M2/1.3.1/BUILD/dan/../../Macaulay2/packages/Macaulay2Doc/test/0-homog.m2
    0-homog.errors:0: error output left here for the errors above:
    make[3]: *** [0-homog.out] Error 127

because the "time" command is not installed

Have the configure script check for it.

Have it also check for "unzip".
