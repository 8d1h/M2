implement (or restore) using LU as in lapack to compute inverses over RR and CC

    i2 : inverse matrix {{1. * ii}}
    -- warning: experimental computation over inexact field begun
    --          results not reliable (one warning given per session)

    o2 = | -i |

		    1          1
    o2 : Matrix CC    <--- CC
		  53         53
