-- Notes on going through the book chapter outputs in version 1.0.9test
-- 29 Jan 2008

-------------
-- preface --
-------------

OK.  The output seems good.

---------------
-- varieties --
---------------

OK.  The output seems good.

Notes:
1. oo / print @@ print
   Another good way to view it: netList oo

2. MonomialSize=>16.  The default is currently 16 or 32.

--------------
-- geometry --
--------------

Output: problem, although it looks correct.
FIX THIS or UNDERSTAND IT!!

Notes:
1. 'top' has been replaced with 'topComponents'
2. decompose works over QQ

-----------------
-- programming --
-----------------

OK.  The output seems good.

Notes:
1. Real numbers can also be input as, e.g. 2e100
     Real numbers can have arbitrary precision now.
2. Function is now called FunctionClosure
3. toExternalString shoul be used instead of toString to obtain 
     machine readable input.
4. Comments can also be multi-line, enclosed by {* and *}
5. Another format for strings: /// ... ///
6. Other newer language features?

-------------
-- schemes --
-------------

Output: The det computation on line i28 takes quite a long time
Otherwise the output seems good.

Notes:
1. Section 5: One can now use local rings in Macaulay2.  For example:
  S = QQ{x,y,z}
  I = ideal(x^5+y^3+z^3, x^3+y^5+z^3, x^3+y^3+z^5);
  degree I
2. Section 8: The definition of blowup given here is special to this stuation.
   The output on line o70 in the book contains a non-minimal generator (the last one).
   The check for non-singularity in line i71 in the book is not correct.  One needs to
   take the 2 x 2 minors of the Jacobian (since codim J == 2):
   radical(J + minors(2,jacobian J)) == ideal gens ring J

--------------------
-- monomialIdeals --
--------------------

Output: is OK, although we need to make one additional change, as in note (3).

Notes:
1. Many of the algorithms mentioned here are now implemented directly in Macaulay2.
2. The 'dual' and primaryDecomposition functions displayed on lines o26 and o27 
   have been rewritten.
3. primaryDecomposition now returns an irredundant primary decomposition.  
   Use irreducibleDecomposition instead of primaryDecomposition:
   -- line i32:
   apply(2..6, i -> #irreducibleDecomposition treeIdeal i)
4. erase symbol x
   instead, use:
   x = symbol x
5. For the discussion between i108, i109: the first entry of a degree vector does not
   need to be positive.  However, a Heft vector is required in the ring in that case.   
   
----------------------------------------------------
-- from enumerative geometry to solving equations --
----------------------------------------------------

Output: is fine, except the random test as in note 1. gives a different answer.

Notes: 
1. line i65, the test fails.  Rerunning it often makes it succeed.  The reason the test fails
   is that Macaulay 2's random number generator has changed since the book was written.


--------------------------------
-- toric Hilbert schemes -------
--------------------------------

Output:

Notes:
1. One does not need to load the file LLL.m2 (in fact, there is no such file!?)
2. polarCone.m2 is now a real package: FourierMotzkin.m2, but the name of the function is fourierMotzkin,
     not polarCone.
3. The computation on line i53 returns a different value.  This is because the choice of variables 
     to remove has changed, probably due to a difference in sorting order of polynomials.
4. The input for lines i55,i56,i57,i58 should now read:
  CX = QQ[a..e, z_1,z_5,z_6,z_11, Weights =>
      {9,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,0}];
  F = map(CX, ring J, matrix{{a,b,c,d,e}} | 
            substitute(G.matrix,CX))
  J1 = F J
  substitute(ideal(z_5^2),CX) + J1

5. The output on line o63 is different, as the output of Groebner bases (and
      consequently the output from leadTerm) is now sorted by lead term.
6. The output on line o66 is different as in note 4 above.  The primary decomposition of the
     ideal on line o66 can be found by:
  primaryDecomposition value o66
