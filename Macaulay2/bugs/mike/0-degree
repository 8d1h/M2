-- fixed 10/3/2010.  For some reason, degree was ignoring variables whose exp was < 0.

ZZ[x, MonomialOrder=>Lex, Inverses=>true]
degree x
degree (x^-1)

end
i11 : ZZ[x, MonomialOrder=>Lex, Inverses=>true]

o11 = ZZ[x]

o11 : PolynomialRing

i12 : degree x



o12 = {1}

o12 : List

i13 : degree x^-1

o13 = {0}						********** oops

o13 : List
