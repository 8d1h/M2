FIXED: used lcm MonomialIdeal instead.

This minor new functionality isn't worth the name space pollution:

    i22 : lcmOfGens monomialIdeal (x*y, y*z^2)

    o22 = {1, 1, 2}

    o22 : List

We could instead add lcm(RingElement,RingElement,...) and lcm(Matrix), and then
you could do "lcm gens I" to get the lcm of the generators, as a ring element,
not as a list of exponents.
