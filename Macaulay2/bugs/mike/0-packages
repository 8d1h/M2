most recent:
packages		BGG.m2				
same			BoijSoederberg.m2		
same			Bruns.m2
same			EdgeIdeals.m2			snowbird changed
packages		FourTiTwo.m2			snowbird out of date, note that there are aux files now.
							I need to install this so I can test it, and build doc for it!
same			GenericInitialIdeal.m2		snowbird is basically the correct one, although some use of rings is not optimal
							tell Alexandra of the small changes I made.
same			LocalRings.m2			one in snowbird was changed alot at snowbird.  Using it.
same			NoetherNormalization.m2		I made small changes: email authors
same			PrimaryDecomposition		snowbird had some good doc and code changes in it
packages		PrimaryDecomposition.m2		DOC is pretty bad still
                                                        bugs to fix: pd over tower rings

same			Regularity.m2			some code added at snowbird.  Using that.
same			Points.m2			
x			ReesAlgebra.m2			this one is now not current
snowbird		ReesAlgebra2.m2			this has the latest code and doc in it
same			SchurFunctors			doc needs work
same			SchurFunctors.m2
same			SchurRings.m2			needs doc,
