-- DONE: pseudoRemainder

-- DONE: methods for normal forms...
-- DONE:	TT I TT C ...
-- DONE:	F%G != 0 shows it's a proper containment
-- DONE:	the Ext is unmotivated

^	other ways in summary
	modernize
	(class x)#1 is junk
	kill link to InverseMethod

-- DONE: ZZ & ZZ	example comes out false!

++	modernize the methods, e.g., Module ++ Module
	GradedModule -- deal with them by referring to ChainComplex

**	methods should point elsewhere

-- DONE: : methods should point to quotient

-- DONE:  ..	text between example boxes

-- DONE: Dan did this.  "ranges and repetitions" -- move any of its good examples to .. or ZZ: and reduce or eliminate this node

-- DONE: Matrix | ZZ -- direct to Matrix | Matrix
-- DONE: ZZ | Matrix	same
-- DONE: Matrix || ZZ -- direct to Matrix || Matrix
-- DONE: ZZ || Matrix	same
