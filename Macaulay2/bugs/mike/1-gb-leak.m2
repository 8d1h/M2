I wrote some code to test that theory, and it seems to hold up, but the code
demonstrate a likely memory leak somwhere.  If I limit it to 200MB then it runs
out of memory after about 10 iterations of the loop below.

Do you have any tools for looking for memory leaks?

gbTrace = 3
R = QQ [x, y, MonomialOrder => Position => Up]
isDiagonal = f -> (
     m := min(rank target f, rank source f);
     R := ring f;
     zr := 0_R;
     f = new MutableMatrix from f;
     scan(m, i -> f_(i,i) = zr);
     f == 0)
scan(100, i -> (
	  f := substitute (random(R^10, R^{10:-2}),y=>1);
	  h := time ultimate(g -> map(R^(rank g), R^(rank g), gens gb transpose g), f);
	  assert isDiagonal h))
