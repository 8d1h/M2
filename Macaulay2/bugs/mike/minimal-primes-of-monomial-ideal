--error: method has no documentation: Macaulay2 :: minimalPrimes MonomialIdeal ::: (minimalPrimes, MonomialIdeal)

I can't figure out what this function thinks it's doing!  Counterintuitively,
it returns an ideal, not a list of prime ideals.

    i3 : minimalPrimes monomialIdeal (x*y,x*z)

    o3 = monomialIdeal (x, y*z)

    o3 : MonomialIdeal of QQ [x, y, z]

    i4 : minimalPrimes monomialIdeal (x,y,z)

    o4 = monomialIdeal(x*y*z)

    o4 : MonomialIdeal of QQ [x, y, z]

One theory: it computes the minimal primes, for each of them it multiplies the
generators together, then it takes the monomial ideal generated by all those
products.

If that's what it's doing it's totally damaged, because MonomialIdeal is not
the only type of object in our system.
