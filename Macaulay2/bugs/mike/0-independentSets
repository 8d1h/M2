I found an issue where independentSets will give incorrect output on
monomial ideals. The bug seems to happen at random - sometimes it
happens quickly, while other times you have to call independentSets
many times on the same ideal before it happens. Here is an example
where the ideal I is from the attached file. Note what happens at
input line 51 in the listing below, where the output is suddenly
different.

i48 : time #independentSets I
    -- used 0.015 seconds
o48 = 3
i49 : time #independentSets I
    -- used 0.016 seconds
o49 = 3
i50 : time #independentSets I
    -- used 0.015 seconds
o50 = 3
i51 : time #independentSets I
    -- used 8.173 seconds
o51 = 49822
i52 : time #independentSets I
    -- used 0. seconds
o52 = 3
i53 : time #independentSets I
    -- used 0.015 seconds
o53 = 3
i54 : time #independentSets I
    -- used 0.016 seconds
o54 = 3

A different issue is that the name is confusing, in that one might as
well expect to get the inclusion-maximal independent sets as to get
the size-maximal independent sets. Perhaps the title in the
documentation at

 http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.2/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_independent__Sets.html

could be changed from

 "independentSets -- some maximal independent subsets of variables
modulo an ideal"

to something like

 "independentSets -- the size-maximal independent subsets of variables
modulo an ideal"


I'm curious what algorithm independentSets uses for monomial ideals -
does anyone on here know? Simple backtracking?
