In this example there is no weight vector, so our new algorithm in rawDivMod
shouldn't fire at all, but it seems to do one subtraction step, anyway.  Is
that right?  Should I document it?  (Dan)


i4 :      R = QQ[x,y, Inverses => true, MonomialOrder => Lex]

o4 = R

o4 : PolynomialRing

i5 :      quotientRemainder(x^100 - x^89, x^5 - 1)

       95   95    89
o5 = (x  , x   - x  )

o5 : Sequence

i6 :      quotientRemainder(x^100 - y^89, x^5 - 1)

       95   95    89
o6 = (x  , x   - y  )

o6 : Sequence
