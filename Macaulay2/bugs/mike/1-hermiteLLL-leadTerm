We have to make these two routines agree on which end of the vector is the
leading end:


    i61 : hermiteLLL random (ZZ^4, ZZ^4)

    o61 = | 0  0   0 1  |
	  | 0  0   1 0  |
	  | 0  14  0 8  |
	  | 17 251 2 13 |

		   4        4
    o61 : Matrix ZZ  <--- ZZ

    i62 : leadTerm oo

    o62 = | 0  0   0 0  |
	  | 0  0   0 0  |
	  | 0  0   0 0  |
	  | 17 251 2 13 |

		   4        4
    o62 : Matrix ZZ  <--- ZZ


=============================================================================


Here's another oddity:

    i69 : leadTerm transpose matrix {{3,3}}

    o69 = | 0 |
	  | 3 |

		   2        1
    o69 : Matrix ZZ  <--- ZZ

    i70 : leadTerm transpose matrix {{3_R,3_R}}

    o70 = | 3 |
	  | 0 |

		  2       1
    o70 : Matrix R  <--- R

    i71 : describe R

    o71 = QQ [x]

Which routine doesn't do auto reduction?  I know you can't be referring to
hermiteLLL, because it's a normal form.  Nor to leadTerm.

Why is LLL part of the name of hermiteLLL???  That must refer only to the
strategy, not to what is being computed.

It would be nice if hermite normal form would be triangular.
