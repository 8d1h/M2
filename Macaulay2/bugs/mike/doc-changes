Mike:

pseudoRemainder

methods for normal forms...
	TT I TT C ...
	F%G != 0 shows it's a proper containment
	the Ext is unmotivated

^	other ways in summary
	modernize
	(class x)#1 is junk
	kill link to InverseMethod

ZZ & ZZ	example comes out false!

++	modernize the methods, e.g., Module ++ Module
	GradedModule -- deal with them by referring to ChainComplex

**	methods should point elsewhere

: methods should point to quotient

..	text between example boxes

"ranges and repetitions" -- move any of its good examples to .. or ZZ: and reduce or eliminate this node

Matrix | ZZ -- direct to Matrix | Matrix
ZZ | Matrix	same
Matrix || ZZ -- direct to Matrix || Matrix
ZZ || Matrix	same
