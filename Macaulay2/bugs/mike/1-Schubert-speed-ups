Ways to speed up Schubert:

1) In case we implement intersection rings via polynomial rings of which the
intersection ring is a quotient, it will be important, perhaps, to be able to
implement the integral of a cycle class by means of a table of the integrals
for each monomial.  Such a table is conveniently represented by a polynomial
whose coefficients are the integrals, and then to integrate an arbitrary
polynomial is to take the dot product of the coefficient vectors.  Hence, it
would be useful to have the dot product of two polynomials as an engine
operation.

2) It would be much faster to implement logg and expp in the engine.
