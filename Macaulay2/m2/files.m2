-- The unix 'cp' command is confusing when copying directories, because the

--    % cp -a a t
--    % cp -a a u
--    % ls t

-- definition of recursive copying is still unclear.

--    % cp -a a/. v
--    % cp -a a/. w
--    % ls v
--    bbbb

--    bbbb
--    % cp -a a z
--    % ls z

-- For safety, we insist the destination directory already exist.
