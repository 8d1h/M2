     computational algebraic geometry and algebraic geometry.  He started writing
     syzygy programs as an undergraduate at the University of Illinois, and from
     1983 to 1992 with David Bayer he wrote Macaulay, a specialized computer
     algebra system for algebraic geometry and the predecessor of this program."
