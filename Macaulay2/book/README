In this directory we have code to convert the online documentation
into book form.  The result doesn't look much like a "book" yet --
we'll work on that.

Type:

	make install

The result:

	M2book.dvi		a printable manual
	M2hbook.dvi		a hypertex version, viewable with xhdvi

These files can also be downloaded separately from us.
