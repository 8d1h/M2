				 Macaulay 2

Macaulay 2 preliminary porting instructions and notes

    We use gcc/g++ version 2.7.2 or 2.7.2.1, gnu make version 3.74, and gawk
3.0; you should install these yourself.  We use various other libraries,
whose sources are included in this distribution for your convenience,
although you may prefer to pick up more recent versions of these libraries.
These libraries have their own copying licenses.  The copying license for
Macaulay 2 is in ./Macaulay2/licenses/README.

To compile Macaulay 2 type 'make' in this directory.  The resulting shell
script, ./Macaulay2/bin/M2, can then be installed in /usr/local/bin.  Local
options (governing profiling, stripping, etc) can be set in the file
Makefile.lcl.
	
-----------------------
Windows 95 and NT notes
-----------------------

We use Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler version 5.0 with service pack 2.
First install the "gnuish" utilities in C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32: awk.exe, cp.exe,
gawk.exe, grep.exe, ls.exe, make.exe, mv.exe, pwd.exe, rm.exe, sed.exe, and
uname.exe.  Then open up the workspace, M2.dsw, set it to build the Release
version, and start it compiling.

This is not quite ready yet, but to try it, cd to ./Macaulay2/m2, and
try 

	..\d\Release\Macaulay2 setup.m2

----------------------
Linux notes
----------------------
You may have to remove the option -lieee from Macaulay2/d/Makefile if the
library doesn't exist on your system.  It exists in Slackware Linux, at least
old versions, but not in RedHat Linux.

----------------------
MS-DOS notes
----------------------

The MS-DOS version is no longer supported, but here are the instructions
previously given.

Install DJGPP v2, available from /ftp@ftp.coast.net:SimTel/vendors/djgpp.
Install all the applications, too: make, ranlib, gawk, ar, sed, ...

Remember to use utod to convert all the *.m2 files in m2, m2/scriptde, and
tutorial/final to the msdos newline conventions.  This will ensure that
embedded strings containing newlines will have the right newline characters
there.

crt0.s: The source is in djlsr201.zip, and needs to be modified according to
	the file Macaulay2/msdos/crt0-diffs to support gc.  Do this manually
	and replace %DJGPP%/lib/crt0.o.
	The variable _go32_info_block is defined in src/libc/go32/infostrc.c.
gmp: Use the file make.bat that comes with it to compile it.
gc: Still needs a bit of work.
factory: Run 
		GMP_INCLUDE_PATH=../include
		export GMP_INCLUDE_PATH
		configure msdos --prefix=../lib --with-memman --with-optimize
	under Linux and then move Makefile and conf.h over.
libfac: The include files factor.h and Factor.h tend to get confused for each
	other.  One thing to try is to remove -I. from IFLAGS in libfac-0.2/Makefile.
