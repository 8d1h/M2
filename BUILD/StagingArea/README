This subdirectory can be used as a place where files can be installed, in such
a way that architecture-independent files get made only once, saving time when
versions for multiple architectures are being built.  

The path to the staging area may be specified explicitly by the user using the
"--with-staging-area" option of the "configure" script, or implicity using the
"--enable-common-staging-area" option.

The "make" target "pre-install" will install the files here, and the "make"
target "install" will copy the files from here to the final installation
directory, if there is one.

Installations will be done here with the SeparateExec option to the
installPackage in Macaulay 2 set to true, so that all the
architecture-independent files are in a subdirectory of this directory called
"common", and the architecture-dependent files will be in other subdirectories,
such as "x86_64-Linux-Ubuntu-8.10".
