This directory may be used as a convenient location for the build directory
trees.  For example, it may contain subdirectories "Linux-i686" and
"Linux-x86_64".  Those directories in turn may contain subdirectories, if
desired, with names such as "ubuntu", "debian", and "ubuntu-debug", or even
"ubuntu/normal" and "ubuntu/debug", serving as the actual build directories.

Th subdirectory CommonStagingArea can be used as a place where files can be
installed, in such a way that architecture-independent files get made only
once, saving time when versions for multiple architectures are being built.

The path to the staging area may be specified explicitly by the user using the
"--with-staging-area" option of the "configure" script, or implicity using the
"--enable-common-staging-area" option.

The "make" target "pre-install" will install the files there, and the "make"
target "install" will copy the files from here to the final installation
directory, if there is one.

Installations will be done here with the SeparateExec option to the
installPackage in Macaulay 2 set to true, so that all the
architecture-independent files are in a subdirectory of this directory called
"common", and the architecture-dependent files will be in other subdirectories,
such as "x86_64-Linux-Ubuntu-8.10".  (Actually, this is being changed...)
