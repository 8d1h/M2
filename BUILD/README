This directory may be used as a convenient location for the build directory
trees.  For example, it may contain subdirectories "Linux-i686" and
"Linux-x86_64".  Those directories in turn may contain subdirectories, if
desired, with names such as "ubuntu", "debian", and "ubuntu-debug", or even
"ubuntu/normal" and "ubuntu/debug", serving as the actual build directories.
