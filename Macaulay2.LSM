Title:          Macaulay 2
Version:        0.8.60
Entered-date:2000-06-08
Description:    Symbolic algebra program designed to support research in
                commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  It's good
                at computing Groebner bases and free resolutions of
                modules over various rings.  This amounts to giving
                qualitative information about systems of polynomial 
                equations in several variables.
Keywords:       equation variety scheme polynomial Macaulay Macaulay2
